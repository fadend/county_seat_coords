# Utility to get the coordinates of county seats via Wikipedia

This is pretty fragile, but it worked for my purposes. Maybe it'll work for you too.

## Usage

```
$ python -m venv seatenv
$ cd seatenv
$ bin/pip3 install git+https://github.com/fadend/county_seat_coords
$ bin/python -m county_seat_coords.fetch_county_seat_coords \
  --county_list_wiki_url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_California \
  --output_csv=county_seats.csv
```
